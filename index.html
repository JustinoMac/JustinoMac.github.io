I was born in Angola, raised in Canada and introduced to the world of technology while completing my high school in Japan.
I'm currently a student in Ankara Yildirim Beyazit University pursuing a Computer Engineering degree. My area of interest is Cybersecuirty with an emphasis  in cryptography, Red Teaming, Governance, Risk and Compliance and Secure DevOps.

My multicultured background is used as an asset in many ways. The ability to constantly getting exposed to different cultures and adapting has made me more in tune with my critical thinking, problem solving and the capibility to have a more positive attitude towards challanges. Another way I use my background as a tool in my arsenal is the ability to have a bird eye views when trying to analyze problems and patterns in humanity, cultures and different societies.
